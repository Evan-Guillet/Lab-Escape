# Lab-Escape üß™
Following a catastrophe in which scientists lost control of their inventions, a laboratory became the scene of a technological catastrophe. Useful and innovative creations have mutated into rebellious machines, decimating their creators and turning the laboratory into a hostile labyrinth.

Nova Vanguard, the lone guardian of the lab, emerges from the shadows to confront the mechanical threat that has taken hold of the laboratory. A former protector of technological advances, Nova now finds himself confronted by his own prot√©g√©s, who have become hostile. Armed only with a blaster and unwavering determination, Nova must navigate the corridors and rooms of the laboratory, battling rampaging robots and interacting with the PCs and components left behind by the missing scientists.

The laboratory is now a cybernetic fortress, with sections devastated by robotic explosions and abandoned research rooms. Nova Vanguard will have to eliminate all the faulty robots that now patrol every nook and cranny.
